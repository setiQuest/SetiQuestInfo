Source code for the Renderer program used for SETILive!

*** What is The Renderer? ***

You can visit http://setilive.org and view waterfall plot representaions
of the complex amplitude data gathered in real time at the Allen
Telescope Array. The data path is generally the following:

1. The Allen Telescope (ATA) Array observes 3 targets in the sky at a time.
2. As it is observing, the data from the ATA is sent to the cloud.
3. TheRenderer program is forever waiting in the cloud for these data files to 
   arrive.
4. The Renderer processes the data, packages it into BSON format data
   files and sends the data to the SETILive servers for their processing.

*** How to build. ***

Your environemnt must be set up properly. See the README.txt file in the
"proj" directory for details. After your environment is set up properly,
do a "make".

*** How to run. ***

There really is not much hope of really running the Renderer unless you have 
the real time data feed from the ATA. But to run, you need to edit the
proj/properties/renderer.properties file with correct values, then
run the "renderer" script in the "bin" directory. Let it run in the background.

** Where it gets the data. ***

The data comes from the ATA, streamed to the server. The data in intercepted
by the filereceiver program, located in the "bin" directory, which gathers the 
data into files that the renderer picks up and processes. Let the 
filereceiver program run in the background.
